            <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I was born in Tehran, Iran, on May 13, 1989. In 2008, while attending college, I commenced my technological journey by learning computer programming in the form of C++.
In 2008, following six months of engagement in offline application programming, I transitioned to the PRO team as a web designer. Within a short time, I was promoted to web developer, specializing in PHP and Python, and have since completed a number of significant projects with substantial responsibilities.
In addition to gaining experience, I have obtained letters of recommendation from international firms during this time period.
As I am extremely interested in expanding my knowledge of artificial intelligence and discovering new aspects of data mining, I made the decision to pursue a master's degree in the field. I successfully defended my dissertation, which focused on emotion analysis and garnered the attention of instructors.
I would like to conduct research on data mining and methods for optimizing application performance, in addition to SEO. I take great pleasure in developing applications and websites. We should share information, as the adage goes: "I share, you share, we learn."
